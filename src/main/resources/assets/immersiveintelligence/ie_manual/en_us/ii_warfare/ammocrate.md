The Ammunition Crate is a portable storage for all the bullets. It can be used to load a revolver, by creating a load pattern and putting the cartridges inside.
To open the crate shift right-click with an empty hand, from there reload both the revolver or the speedloader with one right-click.

With a wrench you can modify the crate to fit a [belt-feed machingun](weapon_upgrades.md#3) or apply an inserter for a way to load turrets by data.

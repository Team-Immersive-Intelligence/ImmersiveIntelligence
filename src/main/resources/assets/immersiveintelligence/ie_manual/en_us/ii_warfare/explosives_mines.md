# radio_satchel0
When your operations require a stealthy, precise approach, radio-detonated satchel charges are the right choice. Be it
mining operations, demolition of buildings or sabotage of train bridges, satchel charges are universal in their role and
are beloved by both combat engineers and saboteurs.

# radio_satchel1
The primary way to detonate the explosive devices is by using a [radio signal](radio_station). To do that, the explosives must first be programmed with a data packet in a [DIM](data_input_machine).

Explosives will only detonate when they receive a data packet identical to the programmed one through radio.
Additionally, explosives can receive data through cable on the exact same conditions and work as a data relay.

# radio_satchel2
Explosives can also be detonated using redstone, similar to other redstone connectors they can receive signal on one of the 16 channels. To change the channel sneak-use a hammer on a placed satchel.

Unlike other explosive casings the **radio-equipped satchel** needs to be crafted. Using leather, basic circuit and iron the paragon of sabotage is born.

# mines
Mines are commonly used as a static defensive measure. Their main use cases are denying the enemy access to an area, 
slowing their advance or in case they aren’t very bright - marking where their graves will be.

Keep in mind landmines do not differentiate between their targets, it is very important to keep a track of your own minefields and use plans instead of placing them randomly.

# landmine0
**Landmines**
Classic, reliable and cheap to produce: this type of landmines is the most widely used one. The way it works is very straightforward: 
it explodes after an enemy steps onto it, causing serious damage. However, dropped items and lightweight critters like chickens will not cause a detonation.

# landmine1
A prominent feature of the landmine is the ability to dig it into any soft block, such as dirt, gravel and clay on which it was placed. 

In order to dig the landmine into the ground, use a shovel on it. Although any shovel would suffice, the trench shovel does that job much faster.
Additionally, you can place grass on top of the landmine to fully conceal it.

# tripmine
**Tripmine**

Sometimes called the jumping landmine is an explosive device, activated not by weight pressure, but by pulling the wire on the top.
After being triggered, the mine will jump out of its casing and explode. In order to be set up, the mine requires linking with another mine or a tripwire connector. 


# naval_mine0
**Naval Mine**

Naval Mines are mines deployed in water, which prevent boats and water creatures from reaching an area, effectively killing them on contact. 
Naval Mines carry a higher amount of components inside, meaning the explosion is greater than one of a landmine and deadly in most of the cases.

# naval_mine1
In order to deploy the **Naval Mine**, first set the chain length by sneaking and scrolling. 
Deploy landmine on a water block, it will deploy an anchor cart with the mine attached to it with a chain. 
The cart will submerge, dragging the mine down with it. The mine will float block equal to the chai length above the cart at the seafloor.
Naval Mines take a few seconds to arm themselves, meaning you can safely deploy them without blowing yourself up.

# mine_sign
While being a simple piece of wood with text written on it, this sign seems to instill some sense of dread in your adversaries.
It's main purpose is designating friendly and hostile minefields, although some use it as a bedroom decoration for some reason. 

*Well, such are Engineers…*

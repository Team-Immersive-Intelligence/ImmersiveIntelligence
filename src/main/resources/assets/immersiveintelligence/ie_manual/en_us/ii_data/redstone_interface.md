The **Redstone Interface** is a device bridging the old but still used [redstone](redstoneWires) with the [data system](data_main.md).
|[text]{mb:"II:RedstoneDataInterface"}|

# details
The machine consists of several parts, but key parts are the [data input port], on which a [data connector](data_wiring.md#connector) has to be placed 
and a [redstone output connector](redstoneWires#1) to which you can attach a [wire](wiring#redstoneWires). 

# interface
In the user interface there are two sections: data to redstone and the opposite.
After you add an entry, you have to specify the variable letter and the corresponding redstone color.

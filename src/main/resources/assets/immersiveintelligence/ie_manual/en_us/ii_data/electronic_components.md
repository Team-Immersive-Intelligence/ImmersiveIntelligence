**Circuits** are one of the most important and commonly used electronic parts. 
There are three kinds of **Circuits**:  
[Basic Circuits](#basic_general) - made using vacuum tubes and redstone  
[Advanced Circuits](#advanced_general) - an enhanced version, which uses [Advanced Electronic Alloy™] and improved vacuum tubes.  
[Processor Circuits](#processor_general) - the most sophisticated ones, made mainly of silicon in a [complicated assembly process](precision_assembler).  

# blueprints
All types of circuit boards require a specialized blueprint to create them.  
*The blueprint should be designed to* [*match*] *the electronic components that are going to be used in them.*

# basic_general
|[item_display]{source:"basic_general"}|
**Basic Circuits** are the common, primary, and cheap circuits.
Their universal design allows them to be easily [refitted](functional_circuits) to perform simple data operations, 
but their main use is construction of various **Data Devices**, such as 
the [Printing Press](printing_press), the [Arithmetic Logic Machine](arithmetic_logic_machine) and the [Data Input Machine](data_input_machine.md).

# basic_components
|[item_display]{source:"basic_electronic_element"}|
**Basic Electronic Components** are created using a [Nickel Plate](metalPress), [Redstone] and a [Vacuum Tubes](components#2.md) in the
[Precision Assembler](precision_assembler.md).

# basic_board
|[blueprint]{source:"basic_circuit_blueprints"}|
To create the Raw basic board, [insulate glass] and copper plates. To define the wanted connection in the board, it requires etching.
This is done in a [chemical bath](chemical_bath.md) using [etching acid].
# advanced_electronic_alloy
|[crafting]{source:"advanced_electronic_alloy"}|
Safeguarded by the Engineering Department, the **Advanced Electronic Alloy™
** is a compound material used in the creation of [Advanced Circuits](#advanced_board).
It is made by combining Constantan, Electrum, and Platinum in proportions 3:2:1, yielding six units a material with
*excellent conductivity and durability*.

# advanced_general  
|[item_display]{source:"%SECTION%"}|
**Advanced Circuits** are a more refined version of their predecessor, created using a double-layered circuit board, **Advanced Electronic Alloy** and improved vacuum tubes.  
They have a broad use in [Wireless Data Transfer](radio_station) and **Advanced Data Devices
**, such as [Advanced Inserters](../ii_logistics/inserters.md) and [Improved Automated Weaponry](../ii_warfare/emplacement).

# advanced_components
|[item_display]{source:"advanced_electronic_element"}|
**Advanced Electric Components** are manufactured with the help of a
[Precision Assembler](precision_assembler.md), give it the right scheme and provide a **basic electronic component** together with an advanced vacuum tube.

# advanced_board
|[blueprint]{source:"advanced_circuit_blueprints"}|
The **Advanced Circuit Board
** is a more sophisticated version of the basic one, this one has room for more connections and more advanced parts.
To make an **Advanced Board** two **Basic Boards
** are required to be combined with a sheet of [Advanced Electronic Alloy](#advanced_electronic_alloy).
# cryptographic_board
|[blueprint]{source:"cryptography_circuit"}|
The **Raw Cryptographic Circuit Board
** is a specially tailored version of the [Raw Advanced Circuit Board](#advanced_board). It is used in the creation of the [Cryptographer Circuit](functions/_functional_circuits.md#cryptographer).

# processor_general  
|[item_display]{source:"%SECTION%"}|
**Processor Circuits** are the most sophisticated and capable circuits in the world.
They are created from silicon, advanced electronic alloy, and various other materials in a complicated assembly process.
They work as the electronic brains of [Mainframe Computers], [Drones] and many [Advanced Weapon Systems]. 

# processor_components
|[item_display]{source:"processor_electronic_element"}|
Being the state-of-the-art electronic component of our times, the **Processor
** is able to perform [programmed operations on data](computers/data_pol.md).
The manufacturing process is sophisticated and requires 32 **transistors**, two **advanced vacuum tubes
** to be combined according to a scheme in a [Precision Assembler](precision_assembler.md).

# processor_board
|[blueprint]{source:"processors_blueprints"}|
The **Raw Processor Board** is a compact high-performance circuit base, consisting of an **Advanced Electronic Alloy
Sheet** layered between two **Raw Advanced Circuit boards**.

# statements
**Statements** are the building blocks of a **POL** program. Each **Statement** has a distinct name itâ€™s called by and performs a different action. 
Examples of an action are setting a value of a variable, stopping the program or running an internal function. 
Each **Statement** takes exactly one line, but some, like the if **Statement** require another statement to work properly.
The following pages list all the **Statements**, their usage and exemplary use cases.

# overview
|[crafting]{source:"pump"}|
The Mechanical Pump operates on the simple principle of pressure differentials driven by rotary power to move fluids. Due to the materials used to construct the Mechanical pump, it can only extract water.

# operation
To operate the pump, A wheel must be connected to the rotary input on the top of the pump, and supplied with rotary power. Like electrical pumps, a redstone signal must be applied to the base of the pump to output fluid.

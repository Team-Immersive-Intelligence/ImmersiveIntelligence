Mk.4/5 Mod Setup Script
Made by Team Immersive Intelligence
Powered by ForgeGradle 2.3 fork by anatawa12

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) ABOUT
This project uses a custom setup script structure.
The setup script is meant to be modular (to a degree) and consists of multiple scripts (modules) contained in the [gradle/] folder.
These are:
 - Boilerplate [boilerplate.gradle] - the core module linking others together and storing the common mod construction code
 - Modworks [modworks.gradle] - handling the ModWorks annotation processor and resource/code generator
 - CoreJar [corejar.gradle] - handling the generation of a core jar, stored inside the main mod jar and code signing required to build it
 - IE Addon [ieaddon.gradle] - handles mod dependencies required to build an Immersive Engineering addon mod

The script offers compatibility with Intellij, which is the IDE preferred by Team II.
For other IDEs refrain to the standard gradle setup, with additions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) INTELLIJ SETUP
Import the project folder using [File>New...>Project from Existing Sources]
The project should automatically be recognised as a gradle project and load the scripts, if it didn't load them, do it manually by using [Gradle>Reload All Gradle Projects].

Navigate to [File>Settings>Build, Execution, Deployment>Build Tools>Gradle] and select 'Build and Run using' to [IntelliJ].
Navigate to [File>Project Structure] and set SDK to a Java 8 (1.8) SDK. In Team II we use Amazon Corretto 8 both locally and on the GitHub Build Action.

Run the [setupDecompWorkspace] Gradle task located in [forgegradle] category and proceed with the setup.
The task may error - in such case reload the gradle project and run the task again.

Run the [genIntellijRuns] task to create Run Configurations.
When selecting a run configuration, set the Classpath (-cp) to [path].[ModName].Main

3) GRADLE.PROPERTIES
Below is a list of all properties, what are they used for and their possible values (if applicable)
Some properties can also be applied from

General Properties
    [modForge] - Forge Version
    [modMappings] - MCP Mappings, used to give programmer-friendly names to the decompiled functions

    [modVersion] - Version of the mod, usually in format major-minor-patch, f.e. 1.2.3
    [modGroup] -
    [modName] -

Used in MCMOD.INFO file, which provides information about the mod to the in-game mod browser
    [mcmod_Name], [mcmod_URL], [mcmod_Description], [mcmod_Developer], [mcmod_Contributors]

Script settings
    [ii_useModworksPreprocessor : true/false] - Whether the project should use the ModWorks Preprocessor (it's a compilation time only dependency (annotation processor) and not a lib required to run the jar)
    [ii_printSourceSets : true/false] - Whether all source sets locations should be printed
    [ii_printOutputDir : true/false] - Whether a link to the output directory [build/libs/] should be printed on finishing build, useful a for manually built jar

CoreJar Script Settings
    [ii_generateCoreJar : true/false] - whether a core jar should be
    [modATPath] - Access Transformer name
    [modASMPath] -
    [modASMClass] -

Jar Signing-Related properties. If keyStore is empty, the code will not be signed
    [keyStore] - Relative or full path to the keystore file
    [keyStoreAlias] - Keystore Username
    [keyStorePass] - Keystore Password
    [keyStoreKeyPass] - Keystore Key Password
    [signSHA1] - SHA1 signature of the fingerprint

Gradlephant Banner properties (the gradle elephant icon can be changed in [gradle/docs/gradlephant.txt])
    [ii_gradlephantTitle] - A mod brought to you by II Team
    [ii_gradlephantLink] - A link to a project repository or homepage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) CUSTOM.GRADLE
[custom.gradle] is a file ignored by the git repository, which can be used to apply special user configuration for the project.
An example could be:
    project.setProperty("someSpecialProperty","value")

    Keep in mind that the property has to exist in [gradle.properties] as well.

Or
    sourceSets {
        newly_added {
            resources {
                srcDir 'src/specific/folder'
            }
        }
    }
    To add a new source set (Check gradle documentation)

Or, a more commonly used
    runClient {
        args("--username=Pabilo8 --uuid=22153f9b49504028911a7d39a2c80101")
    }
    So that running on client will start on a specific account (no password is needed for playing on offline mode)

Settings such as Program Arguments or Environment Variables can also be applied in IntelliJ in Run Configurations

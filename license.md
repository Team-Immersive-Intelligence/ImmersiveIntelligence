Pabilo's Immersive Engineering Addon License 
====================================
### VERSION 1.1.1

To solve a problem with licensing my work on IE addons (for now only Immersive Intelligence) I introduce this license.
With the moment of publishing this license until I clearly state its deprecation, it is the only document that states any rights to elements of this project.
This license is based on Blu's License of Common Sense by BluSunrize, used in Immersive Engineering.

### Terms and Definitions
**Project Author** – the original creator and license holder of this project, Pabilo8
**Internal Contributors** – people officially contributing code and/or resources to the project under the lead of the Project Author – Team Immersive Intelligence
**Foreign Contributor** – all people contributing code and/or resources to the project

#### What you *can* do:
- Look at the code, draw inspiration, copy bits of it to use in your own projects
- Fork this repository and modify its code
- Submit Pull Requests to this repository
- Write other projects that base on this project and its API (Which means other addons and IE itself can integrate amd take code and art assets out of this project)

#### What you *can not* do:
- Claim any of this code to be your property
- Redistribute this project (source or compiled) without explicit permission of the Project Author
- Copy large sections of this code (classes, complex methods) without giving credit
- Monetize any of this project. This means selling the code, compiled projects and also forbids the use of paywalls or "donations" to restrict access to any part of the project's content.

#### What you *have to* abide by:
- If you have used any code from this project (except the API classes), that project must also be visible source. This allows others to learn from your work.
- Give proper credit where it is due when copying portions of the code (see above)

#### On the topic of *resources*:
- Always give credit to original artists/creators
- Always ask for permission before copying assets

#### On the topic of *ingame skins*
- Providing skins for contributors and patrons is limited to the Project Author
- The skins must not give any in-game benefits other than a distinct look.
- Once given, skins once given cannot be revoken; this applies to both contributors and patrons
- Received Patreon skins are clearly stated in rewards for each donation tier
- Contributor skins are custom and can be given according to the will of the project author, treat these as a reward, not as a payment
- It is not possible to trade skins for other skins, currencies, or goods; they are bound to user's UUID

#### Contributing to this repository:
- The original author keeps copyright of their contibuted code and resources
- The Project Author is given rights to usage and modification of the contributed code or resource. Those rights cannot be revoken.
- Any code or resource submitted must be licensed to this project with this license

#### In summary:
Look at the code and learn from it (where possible). 
Draw inspiration, be creative, enjoy yourself. 
Should you find issues, point them out. 
Have an idea how to fix it? Submit a PR.

In case of questions to this license, ask the Project Author on the official Team Immersive Geology discord server.
